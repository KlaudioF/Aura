# Aura

Phase 1 Code
• Shall set-up the Raspberry Pi and configure it for the project
o Shall install the Raspbian OS
o Shall enable SPI and 12C I/O
o Shall install and setup the SW tools
• Shall demonstrate basic understanding of Python coding
o Create simple unit conversion program
o 3 unit conversions types
  -C to F
  -Hr to S
  -m to ft
o Make reversable
o Loops repeatedly until user chooses to quit
  -Quit by typing "quit" or "q"
o Needs to prompt the user to select conversion type and ask for input
  -"Would you like to convert h, s, C, F, m, or ft?"
o Need to create detailed requirements for your chosen program
• Shall demonstrate basic understanding of Raspberry Pi I/O
o Configure LED on breadboard
o Blink LED
o Use 220 Ohm resistor
o GPIO #26 --> GND
o Blink LED every 2 seconds or "Blink Frequency?"
• Shall demonstrate basic understanding of Pygame
o Add a random rectangle to the center of the game screen
o Add random ball to the top-left corner of the game screen
o Add text to the top-right of the game screen
o Shape size and color
o Screen size and color
o Text size, color, and font.

Phase 1 • Shall set-up the Raspberry Pi and configure it for the project -Done in class already

• Shall demonstrate basic understanding of Python coding 
o Create simple unit conversion program 
-Select three unit conversions (Chosen Conversions: Celsius to Fahrenheit, Hours to Seconds, Meters to Feet, and vice-versa.)

• Shall demonstrate basic understanding of Raspberry Pi I/O 
o Configure LED on breadboard 
-Done 
o Blink LED -How often will it blink? It will blink every second forever (after staying on for 10 seconds and staying off for 10 seconds).
-What color will the LED be? The color of the LED will be red.

• Shall demonstrate basic understanding of Pygame 
o Add a random rectangle to the center of the game screen 
-Color? position on screen (x,y)? Size? Color: Green. Position: [120, 100, 400, 150]. Size: 0
o Add random ball to the top-left corner of the game screen 
-Color? position on screen (x,y)? Size? Color: Blue. Position: [35, 35]. Size: 30
o Add text to the top-right of the game screen 
-What will it say? What font? What color? What it Says: "Game Time!" Font: Freesans Color: Black
